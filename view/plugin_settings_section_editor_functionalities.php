	Make it static alse features some enhancements to the editor
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Ability to inject raw html codes such as scripts <span style="color:red">Use with caution</span></strong><br />
			Putting any code between shortcode <strong>[static_code] [/static_code]</strong> will cause the section to be saved unescaped hence custom css and js are possible
		</li>
